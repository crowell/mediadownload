mediadownload v0.1
---------------

REQUIRES

libusb, imagemagick

DESCRIPTION

avidownload is an application that takes recorded video from recent [2006.10.13]
camcorders and recorded pictures from all m400 and m410 still cameras.  this application works with all currently known "saturn" camcorders.
i have tested it with my 3.7 M200 and my 33.04 M230 with repeated success and for pv2s i have tested a few 410s and one 400.  of
course, your mileage may vary.  this comes with no warranty whatsoever, but i hope
it is as useful for you as it is for me

this application is based off of saturnnights' "avidownload" which was based off of the original schallenger framework by enigma,
which was originally based off of an unknown version of ops-for-linux. i have
also integrated segments of source code from Ops-win32 version .20 and
ops-for-linux version .14

ops-for-linux is maintained by ygfperson [iirc], and Ops-win32 is maintained by billw.

USAGE

it's pretty simple.  place your keys in your home directory in a file named
".saturnkeys", like "/home/user/.saturnkeys" and create a folder named
"saturn_vids", like "/home/user/saturn_vids". also for pv2s the keys should also go in the .saturnkeys file and a folder "pv2_pics"  then run the program from any
folder you wish, like "./mediadownload", for instance.  this application can be
ran as a normal user.  if you want the camcorder formatted after the videos are
downloaded, use the "-f" switch, like "./avidownload -f".

"mediadownload" is for intel (x86) platforms, "mediadownload-ppc" is for powerpc platforms (but doesnt exist yet)

INSTALLATION

if you wish, you can copy the "mediadownload" executable into your "/usr/bin"
folder [as root, of course] and you can run it from any location.

COMPILING

with libusb binaries and development files installed, from within the "src"
directory:

 gcc *.c -lusb -lm -llcms -ljpeg -o mediadownload

it's a really short compile :-]
